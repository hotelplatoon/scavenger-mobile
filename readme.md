We had one week for our final project at Code Platoon and we decided to create a mobile app scavenger hunt. 

Users can pick one of three themed hunts and are given clues to locate five checkpoints. They can roam around a city and snap their OWN photos wherever they are and submit them to see if the photo matches the current checkpoint! We used Google Vision to analyze the submitted images, and an S3 Bucket for image storage.
